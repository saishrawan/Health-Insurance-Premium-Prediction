# Health-insurance-premium-prediction

## OBJECTIVE
The main objective of this project is to develop a health insurance price prediction model that can accurately predict the annual medical expenses of a new customer based on their demographic and lifestyle factors. We aim to achieve this by analyzing the existing customersâ€™ data, including their age, smoking habits, body mass index (BMI), and other demographic factors, and their corresponding medical expenses.
We intend to use a variety of data analysis techniques, including exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building, to develop a comprehensive and accurate insurance price prediction model. By developing an accurate insurance price prediction model, this project can help health insurance companies better manage their risk and improve their profitability while providing their customers with affordable and fair insurance pricing.
The key questions we aim to answer through this project are:
1) What are the key demographic and lifestyle factors that most affect a customer's annual medical expenses?
2) What statistical analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms are best suited for developing an insurance price prediction model?
3) How can we improve the accuracy and performance of the insurance price prediction model and ensure that it is robust and reliable?
